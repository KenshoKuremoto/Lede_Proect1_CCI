    <p class="subhead">Why Japan Killed Its 70-Year-Old Rice Index — and Whether the Numbers Justified It</p>
    <p class="byline">By Kensho Kuremoto</p>
    <p><strong>a surge in the price of its staple food—rice.</strong></p>

    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">Over the past 35 years, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for rice has skyrocketed since 2024, far outpacing other items, and shows no sign of slowing down in 2025.</div>
      <div class="step">The last major rice price crisis occurred in 1993, which became a national scandal. But today’s CPI has reached nearly double the level of that event.</div>

    <h2>A Mysterious Rice Crisis — and a Political Prince on a Mission</h2>
    <p>Unlike the 1993 crisis—caused by a clearly identified poor harvest due to an unusually cold summer—this time, the cause of the soaring rice prices remains unclear. Some speculate that wholesalers are hoarding rice; others suggest that government statistics on rice harvests may be flawed.</p>

    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">To tackle the crisis, the government appointed <strong>Shinjiro Koizumi</strong> as Minister of Agriculture—a move that shocked many.</div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Koizumi quickly implemented an emergency policy of releasing government rice stockpiles directly to retailers at discounted prices. The strategy worked as a short-term fix. Koizumi, the son of a legendary former prime minister and <strong>often dubbed Japan’s political “prince,”</strong> is a household name—comparable in stature to what John F. Kennedy Jr. might have become if he had entered politics. His actions have dominated headlines across Japan.</p>
    <p>One of Koizumi’s most controversial moves was to scrap the long-standing Crop Condition Index (CCI), a government statistic that had been published annually for over 70 years. The CCI was designed to quantify the year’s rice crop conditions using 100 as the average baseline, signaling above or below-average yields.</p>
    <p>Koizumi claimed that due to climate change and other factors, the index no longer reflected reality. He announced its discontinuation and proposed replacing it with more precise, tech-driven data using satellite imagery and AI. While some in the agricultural field supported the decision, noting the CCI’s detachment from current conditions, others expressed concern that the move appeared to be driven by public sentiment rather than rigorous policy.</p>
    <p><strong>But was the index truly useless?</strong> Let’s take a look at the actual data.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="scrolly-container">
    <div class="sticky-thing">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/23929422"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">The red line traces Japan’s official Crop Condition Index. While it fluctuated noticeably during the volatile 1990s, the index has appeared more stable since the mid-2000s.</div>
    </div>

  <section class="scrolly-container">
    <div class="sticky-thing">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/23904680"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step"><strong>the last 20 years, the index has not meaningfully reflected actual changes in output.</strong> In contrast, the blue bars represent harvest volumes. Up until around 2006, the two metrics seemed to move in tandem — a lower index often aligned with smaller harvests, and vice versa. But after that point, the relationship begins to break down.</div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The bubble chart plots the CCI (X-axis) against the rice CPI (Y-axis), with the size and color of each bubble representing harvest volume.</p>

      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/23905830"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">Excluding the extreme values from 1993 and 1994, we find no clear correlation between the crop index and rice prices. If the index were meaningful, the bubbles would form a discernible trend—but they do not.</div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="scrolly-container">
    <div class="sticky-thing">
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/23929488"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">Moreover, the 2024 CPI reached 123, while the CCI remained at 101—very similar to years with no pricing spike. This stark contrast implies that the index failed to align with price realities and, by extension, consumer experience.</div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="content">
    <p>These findings support the hypothesis that the CCI had lost touch with the reality of harvest volumes, pricing, and possibly distribution. This aligns with what field experts have sensed and what the government’s decision suggests. Why the index diverged from reality remains a topic of debate—a question best left for future inquiry.</p>
